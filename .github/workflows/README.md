# GitHub Actions

This repository has three Actions workflows:

| Name | Triggers | Branch Restrictions | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Test** | [`push`, `pull_request`] | | This workflow installs and compiles dependencies and assets before running the test and coverage suite against UKCP. |
| **Release** | [`repository_dispatch`: types[`release-trigger`]] | `main` | This workflow runs semantic release against the main branch to tag and publish a new release. |
| **Deploy** | [`repository-dispatch`: types[`manual-trigger`, `deploy-trigger`]] | `main` | This workflow initiates a GitHub deployment, installs and compiles dependenices, generates configuration files from secrets and uploads the application to VATSIM UK's production systems. The workflow is responsible for all server-side file management including version housekeeping. |

## Important Notes

Worklows **Release** is configured to be triggered by upstream workflows. The built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` token available to actions is not permitted to trigger downstream workflows for security and loop prevention purposes. Therefore, both of these jobs need to be triggered using a Personal Access Token with `repo` permissions generated by a user with the ability to write to the repository. This PAT needs to be stored as a secret with the id `PAT`.

**Deploy** Workflow used to be triggered on a release event on `main` but will now trigger on `manual-trigger` events and directly after release (even if no tag is generated) as `deploy-trigger` via `release.yml`

## Triggering a Deployment Manually

This may be necessary from time to time should a given deployment fail or if you need to update the value of a secret and deploy just configuration changes.

There is **no way** to trigger a workflow manually within the GitHub User Interface. However, the workflow will trigger on a repository dispatch event of the type `manual-trigger`. Therefore, we can use an authenticated API request to trigger a deployment.

Below is an example of the curl request you need to make to trigger a deployment.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.github.com/repos/vatsim-uk/uk-controller-api/dispatches \
  -H 'Authorization: token REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "event_type": "manual-trigger",
  "client_payload": {
    "ref": "REPLACE_ME_WITH_THE_TAG_TO_DEPLOY"
  }
}'
```

## .env Configuration

The `deploy.yml` workflow has been designed to populate the .env file based on a secret with the contents of the entire .env file.

To add a new value to the .env file, simply update the ENV_FILE_CONTENTS secret.

## Secrets

Workflows running on main require a number of secrets to run successfuly. **If a secret is not present, it will be presented to the job as `null` or `0` and will lead to unexpected results**

### Job Secrets

Below is a table of all secrets used within the workflows directly. See [.env Configuration](#.env-Configuration) for secrets used when generating the .env configuration file.

| Name | Used In | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `PAT` | [`test.yml`, `release.yml`] | Personal Access Token with `repo` permissions. More Info: see above under [Actions -> Important Notes](#important-notes) |
| `ACTIONS_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` | `deploy.yml` | Discord Incoming Webhook Token for Deployment status notifications |
| `APPLICATION_ROOT` | `deploy.yml` | Specifies the target deployment application root for use when uploading and for creating / managing additional app directories / links. |
| `SSH_HOST` | `deploy.yml` | SSH target host for deployment |
| `SSH_PORT` | `deploy.yml` | SSH port for deployment |
| `SSH_KEY` | `deploy.yml` | SSH Private Key for Authentication against remote server |
| `SSH_USER` | `deploy.yml` | SSH username for deployment |
